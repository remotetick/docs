    Data is safely secured through our self-hosted database. While we do collect information such as usernames, and user id's, that information never leaves the database, regardless of how sensitive the information may be, to ensure that data is kept safe

    Comet is written mainly in JavaScript, utilizing the Node.js and the Discord.js libraries. Other languages such as HTML, CSS, and TypeScript are necessary for the app's core features. All of these languages build an intricate app that is saved within GitHub
